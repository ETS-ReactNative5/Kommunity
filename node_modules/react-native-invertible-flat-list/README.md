Full version list located [here](https://github.com/nickcharles/react-native-invertible-flat-list/blob/master/VERSIONS.md).

## Behavior

Behaves identically to the React Native [FlatList](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist.html) component with the added functionality of being invertible. The classic example of this is a chat application where the most recent items are listed at the very bottom of a scrolling list that takes the user back in time. This works for both vertically scrolling and horizontally scrolling lists.
